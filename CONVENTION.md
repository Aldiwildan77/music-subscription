# Project Convention

1. Indentation and spacing between code constructs (classes/methods/specs) must be consistent (2 SPACES).
2. Newlines at end of file.
3. Follow accepted naming conventions for your language/framework.
4. Follow accepted naming file and Directory structure for your language/framework.
5. No comments/Unused Code/Unused file/Unused folder must ever be checked in.
6. Use `.gitignore`.
7. Test Driven Development (this should show in clear pattern in the commit log - one spec, `one code change per commit`)
